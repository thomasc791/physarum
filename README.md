## Physarum

A fast implementation of the physarum algorithm by Jones, J. using OpenGL in C++ and GLSL. The package uses [opengl](https://github.com/thomasc791/opengl) to access some OpenGL functionality.

The user can change a couple of different parameters, such as the sample distance, the sample angle and the turning angle. A preview of program is given below.
